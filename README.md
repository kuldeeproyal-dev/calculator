## 📌 Description

This simple calculator mimics the functionality of a standard calculator. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (−)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)

The calculator interface is clean and styled using CSS, with support for user input through clickable buttons. A JavaScript extension (optional) can also be added to allow keyboard-based interaction.

This project was created as part of a front-end learning journey and serves as a base for future extensions like scientific functions, history tracking, or mobile responsiveness improvements.
